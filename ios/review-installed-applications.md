# Review Installed Applications

## App Store

App Store is the only mass-market source of apps on iOS. Apps published on the App Store have been reviewed by Apple, thus can be seen as relatively safe. However, it is possible for malwares to slip by Apple's checks.

Malicious apps that take full control of the device are rare on the App Store, but there are apps that trick users into entering their personal information or subscribe to expensive services.

## [Enterprise Apps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204460)

Organizations can distribute their internal apps outside of the App Store, but they must register with Apple. These apps are not reviewed by Apple and could contain malware.

Check enterprise apps by going to Settings > General > Profiles or Profiles & Device Management, and look under the "Enterprise App" heading. Make sure no unknown enterprise apps are installed.
