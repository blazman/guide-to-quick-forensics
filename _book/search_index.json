to Quick Forensics\nOften times, members of civil society have the more or less justified suspicion of being surveilled. Perhaps they experienced anomalies with their computers or mobile devices, or they have reasons to believe that some of their communications have been intercepted.\nTechnologists and first responders working in civil society are often requested assistance with the inspection of human rights defenders' devices.\nThe purpose of this guide is to provide an introduction to a methodology that could be useful for the quick assessment of potential infections.\nWhile the methodology introduced here by no means is sufficient to provide a definitive and conclusive assessment over the cleanliness of a suspected device, it can help at least to identify the more obvious infections. Ultimately, it is up to your intuition and understanding of the context to determine what are the best recommendations to give. Hopefully this guide will help you getting started doing Quick Forensics, and will provide you the tools and techniques to start practicing and developing your skills.\nNote: this guide is currently under development. You can contribute to this text here.\nWhy do Quick Forensics?\nLearning to perform quick forensics helps determine whether additional resources might be required or not.\nLearning to triage helps determine whether the case requires additional resources or not.\nBeing able to extract relevant data means that in-depth investigators will not need access to the device (at least, not immediately).\nMore people doing triaging, means better scalability of incident response in civil society.\nResearchers working on targeted threats against civil society are few, and mostly focused on publications.\nThe objectives\nWhen performing quick forensics and responding to a potential compromise, we have the following broad objectives:\n\nTry to determine if the device is indeed potentially infected.\nExtract sufficient data for subsequent verification and that could be useful for further investigation (for example, to determine what type of malware infected the device).\nDetermine what to do with the device and how to further assist its owner.\n\n"},"preparations.html":{"url":"preparations.html","title":"Preparations","keywords":"","body":"Preparations\nThere are many ways to inspect a device and acquire data. There are some initial considerations to make before proceeding. Some of these could be:\nSafety: Is it safe for the owner to proceed? What if we get it wrong? Is the owner at significant risk?\nBackup: Is there a possibility that the triaging would cause loss of data? Are there backups?\nMethodology: Do we think there are opportunities for litigation? If so, is the way we acquire data going to hinder them?\n"},"safety.html":{"url":"safety.html","title":"Safety","keywords":"","body":"Safety\nSafety of the owner of the device is paramount.\nBefore even beginning the engagement, it is important we considered possible negative consequences for the device owner's safety. Firstly, we need to properly assess the risk the owner of the device is currently exposed to. Secondly, we need to determine whether the assistance we are going to provide could cause further exposure. Despite the best intentions, and the owner's likely desire to be reassured and feel comfortable using their devices free of spyware, the activities we are about to perform could, for example, cause retaliation or expedite a response on the attacker's part. We need to be prepared for such eventuality: in some cases, it might be even more prudent to not continue with the engagement at all if it would be too risky.\nIn order to help you estimate the level of risk faced by the owner of the device, and to prepare an appropriate action plan, following are some important questions you should try to answer in advance:\n\nIs it safe for the owner to bring the device to you? If the device is monitored, would any location tracking further jeopardize the owner?\nIf you find an infection, you almost always would not want to let the owner continue using the device. Do you have a plan for replacement? Attackers might notice that the victim has suddenly disappeared.\nIf the device is replaced, would the attacker losing access to the victim cause further retaliation?\nIs the owner in immediate danger? If we wrongly determine that the device is clean, how could this negatively affect the owner?\n\nAnswering these questions will hopefully help you decide if and how to proceed with the quick forensics of the devices.\nShould the device connect online?\nIf you decide to proceed with the inspection, you most likely also want to plan to have the device to be completely disconnected from any WiFi or mobile Internet connection.\nIn the case of a laptop, ideally you should ask the owner to disable the WiFi before turning it off and bringing the device to you. Either way, make sure no connection is available before starting. In the case of a mobile phone, you might want to ask the owner to turn the device off and remove the SIM card before bringing it to you.\nKeep your tools on an external USB drive. Limit transfer of files, and clean leftovers once you are done.\nBear in mind, even with all these precautions, if the triaging is mistakenly concluded with nothing found and the owner resumes using it, it is still quite likely the attacker will notice. A trojan might take screenshots of the desktop while you are operating, or even record the audio from the microphone. In case something is found, you do not want to let it send such data to the attacker.\n"},"trust.html":{"url":"trust.html","title":"Trust","keywords":"","body":"A note on Trust\nWhen asking you to check it, the owner of the device is trusting you with likely the most intimate possession they have. Be mindful of that.\nFor example, when checking phones it might be inevitable to have to go through SMS and WhatsApp messages to find potential malicious ones. When checking through computers, you might come across documents and personal pictures. In some cases, going through such data stored on their devices might resurrect traumatic experiences. Be mindful of that too.\nIn some cases you might need the owner of the device to enter their password, such as for example when checking Mac computers, or entering the PIN code to unlock their phone. Obviously, avoid watching over as passwords are being entered.\nMake sure you comfort the owner, explain them exactly what you are going to do, ask for their consent, and offer to interrupt at any time.\n"},"backup.html":{"url":"backup.html","title":"Backup","keywords":"","body":"Backup\nAlthough under normal circumstances it shouldn't happen, there's always the eventuality that some tools, while performing some aggressive checks, particularly on older or cluttered systems, might cause some instability and crashes. You should be prepared for this eventuality. It might also be the case that if you find the device to be infected, you might want to safekeep it and the owner will want to recover some data.\nIt is advisable that before proceeding with the inspection you make sure the owner is aware of any risk of data loss, and that all steps have been taken to preserve at the very least the most critical files. Of course, a full and secure backup of the system is a much more preferable option, but circumstances and time do not always allow for that.\nAlong with a USB drive with the collection of tools you might need for the inspection, you should consider always carrying an extra drive with you (perhaps with VeraCrypt or any other file encryption utility you prefer) to be used in case you need to preserve some files from the device.\n"},"methodology.html":{"url":"methodology.html","title":"Methodology","keywords":"","body":"Methodology\nThe methodology for doing quick forensics can be quite ad-hoc, and eventually with time you will develop your own. This guide should help in this process. Generally, when trying to triage a possible infection, you will like for any anomaly that you are able to identify on the device. Such anomalies, for example, can be:\n\nApplications and processes running on the device that you and the owner of the device do not recognize. Applications and processes that show some unusual characteristics, such as suspicious names and file locations, or attempts at hiding.\nBecause spyware normally would want to be able to survive a shutdown of the device, you will look for applications which maintain persistence over the device and are therefore registered for automatic execution at startup.\nSuspicious network connections to infrastructure and services that you and the owner of the device do not recognize.\nAccounts, profiles or configurations that do not belong to the device owner.\n\nWhile it is not possible to compile an exhaustive checklist of precise anomalies to look out for, the process of developing a robust quick forensics methodology will require training your eye, by inspecting as many devices you can get your hands. Eventually, you will start recognizing patterns across various operating systems, and become more rapid and efficient at discarding legitimate applications and spotting those that stand out. It takes practice.\nWarning: the methodology we describe in this guide heavily relies on using tools that are publicly available and highly popular. Because of this, more sophisticated malware might be capable of bypassing or evading these tools and trick you into believing you are looking at a clean system. Therefore, this methodology needs to be considered a best effort. You have to take into account the possibility of false negatives and adjust your assessment accordingly (particularly in relation to the device owner's safety).\nConsiderations on legal litigation\nUnder some circumstances, it is possible that the owner of the device has an interest in pursuing some legal action against the perpetrators of the attack you are documenting, or perhaps the producers of the technology used to conduct it. This could be the case, for example, with victims of domestic abuse, or perhaps with activists seeking to prove some illegal surveillance of their communications.\nIf you believe the person you are assisting might be interested in any form of legal litigation, especially based on your work, you might need to adapt your methodology. From country to country, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, rules and best practices for gathering digital evidence admissible in court can vary. Generally, because of chain of custody and to safeguard the integrity of the device, data acquisition (especially from phones) might be heavily restricted.\nYou should inform yourself about the laws and the standard practices from the jurisdiction you normally operate in. Ideally, you should seek advise from local forensics specialists and maybe even seek the assistance of an accredited forensics firm.\n"},"windows.html":{"url":"windows.html","title":"Checking Windows Computers","keywords":"","body":"Checking Windows Computers\nIn this section we will go through some of the basic steps to take when checking a suspected Windows computer.

Reviewing applications starting automatically is thus one of the first checks to perform when looking for potential infections. Windows computers have different ways to enable automatic launch, and spyware often use tricks to appear legitimate and/or avoid the most common methods.\nSysinternals Autoruns is a tool that allows to exhaustively list programs running on start-up. If possible, you should run this program as Administrator:\n\nAll results will be displayed by default in the main tab. Clicking through the other available tabs will filter the results by the respective auto-launch type. The most interesting ones generally would be Logon, Scheduled Tasks, Services.\nLooking for suspicious patterns\nAutoruns does not automatically determine for you which file are malicious and which not. As with the rest of this methodology, it is necessary for you to eventually become familiar enough with its results to quickly spot any anomalies or entries that you do not recognize. However, Autoruns can provide some useful indications.\nSometimes, Autoruns might flag a particular row with a red background. These might warrant further inspection, as it might be a sign of an unusual entry. Entries marked with a yellow background instead refer to files that do no longer exist on the computer. These entries are therefore broken.\nFollowing are some suggestions on patterns to look out for.\n1. Verify image signatures\nIn modern versions of Windows, legitimate applications are generally required to be \"signed\" with a developer certificate. Such certificates allow to verify the producer of a particular program (such as Microsoft, Google, Adobe, or else). Applications that are not signed normally are more controlled and scrutinized by Windows security mechanisms (such as its embedded antivirus, Windows Defender). A useful first check is to verify whether all applications launching automatically are indeed signed, and this can be done by clicking Options > Scan Options and enabling Verify code signatures.\n\nThis will relaunch Autoruns' scan and will add a new column called \"Publisher\". Correctly signed applications will be marked as \"(Verified)\":\n\nBeware: Not all verified Autorun Entries are necessarily safe. Sometimes attackers purposefully abuse legitimate verified applications in order to appear less suspicious, and use them as launchers to then load and execute malicious code. This is sometimes done using, for example, Microsoft rundll32.exe or other applications affected by what's known as DLL Sideloading.\n2. Check the name of the Autorun Entry\nAutorun Entry show the name that was given to the application by its developers. This information can be faked, but sometimes attackers are lazy enough to either mispell spoofed legitimate names (e.g. \"Micorsoft Ofice\" or \"Crhome\") or to just leave random characters and numbers.\n3. Check the program description\nSimilarly, this is not a reliable indicator, but legitimate applications should generally have a program description visible.\n4. Check the Image Path\nWindows provides some standard folders where legitimate applications are normally installed and run from. Services from the operating system itself are normally located under C:\\Windows\\, while user-installed applications are generally located under C:\\Program Files\\ or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\. Because installing programs in those folder should require some confirmation from the user, attackers often place their malicious files in less typical folders, such as C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\ or other subfolders in C:\\Users\\.\nExample of suspicious entries:\n\nThe KeyBoy spyware creates a Registry Key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\shell with the value explorer.exe,C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\cfs.dal\" cfsUpdate\nA particular malware used in Central Asia relies on the use of VBScripts, which are highlighted by Autoruns with a red background, pretending to be Adobe and Google software. These results would definitely warrant further inspection. In addition, the scripts are located under C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\:\n\n\nOptional: 5. Looking up programs on VirusTotal\nOptionally Autoruns allows to check binary files against VirusTotal, which helps to immediately identify any malicious program that is well-known and widely detected by Antivirus software (read more about this in the section below). To enable this check, go in Options > Scan Options and enable \"Check VirusTotal.com\". Be careful not to enable \"Submit Unknown Files\", as it would make Autoruns automatically upload the local files to the service, rather than just looking up their cryptographic hashes. VirusTotal is a company, now owned by Alphabet (Google's parent company), and it provides commercial access to its data to security researchers and customers all around the world. Those with access to VirusTotal commercial services are able to look-up and download any uploaded file. Therefore, you might want to avoid inadvertedly submitting any files that might be confidential.\n\nOnce the VirusTotal option is enabled, it will take some time for results to appear. Eventually, you should see a VirusTotal column displaying the Antivirus scan results. The results appear as a X/Y value, where X is the number of positive detections and Y is the total amount of Antivirus software the file was scanned with.\n\nIf no result is displayed, it means that that particular program has not been previously uploaded to VirusTotal, and it might warrant additional inspection. Sometimes, you wil see some applications with a low detection number (1 or 2): often these are false positives. VirusTotal results showing a higher detection number (for example, 5 and above) is generally a reliable sign that that particular application is malicious. Clicking on the link from the X/Y will open up the browser to the VirusTotal analysis, where you can see more details, such as any malware identifiers used by the Antivirus software supported.\nPlease note: As discussed, under normal circumstances you would prefer to not connect the tested computer to the Internet. Without an Internet connection, you are not able to immediately check with VirusTotal. However, it is possible to save Autoruns results clicking File > Save... and later open the results from a separate computer with Internet connection.\n"},"windows/processes.html":{"url":"windows/processes.html","title":"Review Running Processes","keywords":"","body":"Review Running Processes\nA computer infected with spyware should have some malicious processes running at all times, monitoring the system and collecting data to be transmitted to the Command & Control server of the attackers. Therefore, another required step in triaging a suspected Windows computer is to extract the list of running processes and find if any of them display suspicious characteristics.\nThere are a couple of tools available in order to do this.\nWarning: more sophisticated spyware might be capable of evading this tool by either hiding its own entries from the tree, or by perhaps terminating immediately if they observe any of these tools being launched. In this guide we provide some initial methodology and suggestions to perform an initial assessment. A clean process list is not necessarily a guarantee of a clean system.\nBefore proceeding with this check, it is advisable that you close all visible running applications, in order to reduce the outputs of the tools you will run to the bare minimum.\nProcess Explorer\nProcess Explorer is another tool from the Sysinternals Suite by Microsoft, and it lists all the processes running on the system in a tree:\n\nThe methodology to check for suspicious running processes is somewhat similar to what we described in the Review Programs Launching at Startup section.\n1. Verify image signatures\nSimilarly to Autoruns, Process Explorer also allows to verify signatures of applications running by clicking Options and enabling \"Verify Image Signatures\". The same considerations and warnings we described in the previous section apply here too. Even more so with running processes, the fact that a process application is signed does not necessarily mean it is safe. Malware often makes use of techniques such as Process Hollowing or DLL Sideloading in order to execute code from inside the context of a legitimate and signed application in order to thwart detection.\n\n2. Look for Scripts\nAttackers these days often make use of Microsoft Windows scripting capabilities, such as PowerShell and Windows Script Host, because of their flexibility and even ability to evade detection. These scripting engines are commonly used by enterprise customers to automate configurations of internal systems. It is less common to see consumer applications use them, therefore any related processes running should be further inspected.\nThese processes normally would be called powershell.exe or wscript.exe.\nFollowing is an example of Process Explorer displaying an obviously malicious PowerShell script running on the system:\n\nHovering with the cursor over the process name shows the command-line arguments where we can clearly see the script is attempting to download and execute some additional code. Notice also the use of variating lower and upper case, such as \"doWnLoAdfile\": this is a very basic trick attackers use to evade equally basic detection patterns by security software.\n3. Look for running DLLs\nMalware sometimes also comes in the form of a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) which, opposite to a standalone application (in other words, a .exe file), needs to be launched by a loader. Windows provides a few programs to launch DLLs, commonly regsvr32.exe and rundll32.exe, which are signed by Microsoft.\nLook out for any of those processes running, and try to determine what DLL file they are executing. For example, in the screenshot below, we can see an infected Windows system running a malicious DLL file located under C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\ using regsvr32.exe.\n\n4. Look for processes of applications that should be visible\nAmong the many techniques often used by attackers there is, for example, Process Hollowing. Process Hollowing consists in launching a legitimate application (such as Internet Explorer or Google Chrome), emptying its memory and replacing it with malicious code, which will then be executed. This is normally done to hide the malicious code, make it appear as a legitimate application (which would then only be an empty shell), evade applications firewall and perhaps evade some other security products.\nFor exampe, if you see a running iexplore.exe process, when there is obviously no open Internet Explorer window, you should consider this a worrying sign.\n\nOptional: 5. Looking up programs on VirusTotal\nSimilarly to Autoruns section, Process Explorer also offers to look-up running processes on VirusTotal by searching the cryptographic hash of the respective executable files. This can be enabled by clicking Options > VirusTotal.com and enabling Check VirusTotal.com.\n\nPlease note: the same considerations and warnings explained in the previous section apply here too. Make sure to read them before proceeding.\nCrowdInspect\nCrowdInspect is a tool produced by the American security company CrowdStrike. CrowdInspect is very similar to Process Explorer, but it has some advantages. Firstly, the information presented tends to be more compact. Secondly, it does not only show currently live processes, but it also can show processes that have terminated since it launch (that you might have perhaps missed because they executed too quickly). Lastly, it performs a number more checks that Process Explorer currently does not support.\n\nCheck for any process injections\nProbably the most interesting feature CrowdInspect introduces, is the ability to identify any injected processes. Process injection is a category of techniques whose objective is run malicious code within the context of a separate, generally legitimate, application (such as explorer.exe). Process injection is often used by malware authors in order to obtain additional privileges on the system or, for example, to evade detection.\nCrowdInspect will alert you of any injected processes by displaying a visible red dot under the \"Inject\" column. Injected processes are generally a very good indicator that there might be an active infection on the tested computer.\n\n"},"windows/network.html":{"url":"windows/network.html","title":"Review Network Connections","keywords":"","body":"Review Network Connections\nSpyware will eventually need to transmit the collected data (such as screenshots, passwords, keystrokes, etc.) to a remote location, the Command & Control server. While it is not possible to be able to predict when such transmission will occur, it is possible that some spyware will establish a permanent connection with the server, or that it will connect frequently enough for you to catch it.\nIn order to do check for ongoing connections you can, for example, record the whole network traffic using Wireshark and later inspect the stored results. However, a more interesting approach is to use tools that not only monitor the network activity, but that can also tie them to running processes. Generally, you should look for unusual processes connecting to suspicious IP addresses.\nOne popular tool to do this is TCPView, also from the Sysinternals Suite by Microsoft.\n\nThe tool is pretty straightforward: it lists all established network connections and provide information on the originating process, and the destination. You will likely be surprised to observe the amount of network connections active even with seemingly idle systems. Most often you will see network activity from background processes for example for Microsoft services, Google Chrome, Adobe Reader, Skype, etc.\nAnother tool we can use to observe active network connections is CrowdInspect, which we showcased in the previous section on reviewing running processes. The information provided by CrowdInspect is very similar to that provided by TCPView.\n\nFor example, in the screenshot above we can see a running iexplore.exe process that not only has been flagged as injected, but seems to be actively attempting to connect to the Remote IP 216.6.0.28. Because there is no visible Internet Explorer running on the system it is definitely suspicious to see active network connections from it. TCPView would appear like following on the same infected system:\n\n(Note: these tools show display attempted connections to remote locations even if the computer is at the moment disconnected from the Internet).\nWhen you are suspicious of an active connection, you can (preferably from a separate computer) look up the IP address and try to determine who it belongs to and whether it is known to be good or bad. For example, a simple WHOIS lookup for that IP address would return:\nNetRange:       216.6.0.0 - 216.6.1.255\nCIDR:           216.6.0.0/23\nNetName:        SYRIAN-5\nNetHandle:      NET-216-6-0-0-2\nParent:         TATAC-ARIN-9 (NET-216-6-0-0-1)\nNetType:        Reassigned\nOriginAS:       \nOrganization:   STE (Syrian Telecommunications Establishment) (SSTE)\nRegDate:        2005-07-21\nUpdated:        2005-07-21\nComment:        Fax-no-963 11 3739765\nRef:            https://rdap.arin.net/registry/ip/216.6.0.0\n\n\nOrgName:        STE (Syrian Telecommunications Establishment)\nOrgId:          SSTE\nAddress:        Fayz Mansour St\nAddress:        STE Building\nCity:           Damascus\nStateProv:      \nPostalCode:     \nCountry:        SY\nRegDate:        2005-07-21\nUpdated:        2011-09-24\nRef:            https://rdap.arin.net/registry/entity/SSTE\nThis suggests that the injected iexplore.exe was very suspiciously attempting to connect to an IP address located in Syria. Indeed, for the purpose of demonstration, we used an old copy of  DarkComet RAT that was found used in Syria around 2011.\nEven a simple search of the IP address over your preferred search engine might reveal useful information. Additionally, you might want to consider using threat research services such as RiskIQ or ThreatMiner to see if they have any information on the IP addresses or domain names you come across.\n"},"windows/extract.html":{"url":"windows/extract.html","title":"Extract Data for Further Analysis","keywords":"","body":"Extract Data for Further Analysis\nSnoopdigg is a tool that allows to dump startup information and actual processes, along with memory for further analysis.

This information can be faked, but sometimes attackers are lazy enough to either mispell spoofed legitimate names (e.g. \"Micorsoft Ofice\" or \"Crhome\") or to just leave random characters and numbers.\nMacOS applications are typically installed in a few folders depending on the type of application. Seeing an application running on startup from a non-standard folder does not mean it is malicious but is definitely suspicious and should be checked more in depth.\nHere are the standard folders :\n\nBrowser extensions are typically running from /Users//Library/Application Support\nKernel Extensions : /Library/Extensions or /System/Library/Extensions/\nOther applications : /Library and /Applications\n\n3. Check VirusTotal Scan Results\nDuring the scan, KnockKnock is checking the fingerprint of applications running on startup over the VirusTotal database and showing the result in the menu.\n\nAny file identified as malicious y at least one antivirus in VirusTotal should be checked (although there are some false positive, keep that in mind if a very small number of antiviruses only are detecting it as malicious). A file not known by VirusTotal is also suspicious as their database contains most common legitimate applications.\n\nPlease note: As discussed, under normal circumstances you would prefer to not connect the tested computer to the Internet. Without an Internet connection, you are not able to immediately check with VirusTotal. However, it is possible to save KnockKnock results clicking Settings > save scan results and later open the results from a separate computer with Internet connection.\n"},"mac/processes.html":{"url":"mac/processes.html","title":"Review Running Processes","keywords":"","body":"Review Running Processes\nA computer infected with spyware should have some malicious processes running at all times, monitoring the system and collecting data to be transmitted to the Command & Control server of the attackers.

You first need to download the program from its official page, unzip the archive containing the program  (double-clicking on it should work in most cases) and double-click on the TaskExplorer program to launch it. On startup, it will ask for your password in order to get administrator privileges to list all the processes running.\n\nBefore proceeding with this check, it is advisable that you close all visible running applications, in order to reduce the outputs of the tools you will run to the bare minimum.\n1. Verify Image Signature\nSimilarly to KnockKnock, TaskExplorer verifies the signature of applications running. This information is shown with a loc icon near the Application name, a green closed lock  means that an application belong to Apple, a black closed lock  means that it is a Non-Apple signed application and an open orange lock  means that the application is not signed.\nYou can filter tasks to see only non-signed applications by writing #unsigned in the filtering bar and hit enter :\n\n2. Check for Suspicious Application Name and Path\nAs in the startup section, it is interesting to check for any application that has a suspicious name and path. The name of the application can be faked but in some cases, malware are using either spoofed name with typos (such as Crhome) or random strings.\nThe path of the application gives indication on where the application is running from. Any application running from a location other than /Library or /Applications should be investigated further.\nTo avoid checking legitimate applications signed by Apple, you can filter the tasks with the hashtag #nonapple in the fitering bar :\n\n3.

Apple has built a reputation for itself on uncompromising security for their products, and the numerous improvements and features introduced in iOS devices has made them notoriously hard to break in.\nUnfortunately, this also affects our ability to inspect an iOS device to identify an infection, even with the consent of its owner.\nHowever, there are some checks we can perform to at least rule out some possibilities and determine how to proceed.\nIn this section, we are going to demonstrate the use of the following tools:\n\nlibimobiledevice\n-\n\n"},"ios/icloud.html":{"url":"ios/icloud.html","title":"Review iCloud Accounts","keywords":"","body":"Review iCloud Accounts\nLow-sophistication attackers might be able to monitor the activity of an iOS device by adding an additional iCloud account. The account would then normally be configured to automatically backup to iCloud all the data available on the phone (such as pictures, messages, contacts, etc.). The addition of an iCloud account normally requires physical access to the device. Once the iCloud account is enabled on the device, attackers are then simply able to inspect the data directly from iCloud or using an external service that synchronizes with iCloud. For example, most stalkerware and \"parental control\" services are increasingly adopting this technique, and advertising it as a \"No-Jailbreak\" service.\nChecking if an iOS device has unwanted iCloud accounts can be trivially done by opening the Settings and looking at the very top of the menu.\nAttackers Using Stolen Credentials\nObviously, if attackers have managed to steal the credentials to the legitimate iCloud account of the device owner, it is not necessary for them to add an additional account to the phone, leaving no visible trace. This is also a common tactic. In this case, a potential check to perform is to look for any unrecognized device that appear to be enabled on the existing account. Here are instructions on how to review connected devices.\n\nImage from Apple\n"},"ios/mdm.html":{"url":"ios/mdm.html","title":"Check for Mobile Device Management Profiles","keywords":"","body":"Check for Mobile Device Management Profiles\nMobile Device Management (MDM) is a system commonly used by enterprises to control a fleet of mobile devices, and be able to, for example, issue configuration updates, install applications, or remotely wipe the data in case the device is lost. Attackers have sometimes been seen abuse MDM in order to maintain control over their victims' phones, and install malicious applications.\nThe enrollment normally requires some manual interaction. An infection could happen, for example, if the attackers manage to obtain physical access to device (even for a short time), or by somehow social engineering the victims into enrolling themselves.\nSimilarly to malicious iCloud accounts, MDM profiles should be visible in the settings of the device. If an MDM profile is installed on the device, opening \"Settings\", then \"General\", should reveal a \"Profile\" or \"Device Management\" menu option, typically below the \"iTunes Wi-Fi Sync\" and \"VPN\" menu options.\n\nImage from BlackBag Technologies\nIf the device owner does not recognize the MDM profile, and if the MDM profile does not appear to belong to an organization or company the device owner works with, it is possible that the device has been compromised.\n"},"ios/jailbreaks.html":{"url":"ios/jailbreaks.html","title":"Check for Jailbreaks","keywords":"","body":"Check for Jailbreaks\nIn order to install spyware on an iOS device, attackers need to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system. Apple has made this task significantly harder over the years, and such exploits have become more difficult and more expensive to produce. Remote Exploits (attacking, for example, WhatsApp, iMessage or Safari) are particularly rare and costly, and are only accessible to resourceful attackers, typically governments. In the case that an iOS device was indeed compromised with a private, commercial-grade sophisticated exploit, it is likely the case that the only check you can perform is of the outgoing network traffic.\nJailbreaks are exploits for mobile devices, in this case iPhones and iPads, that are typically installed manually on the phone and which disable certain security features of iOS. New jailbreaks are regularly made available to the public and attackers might use them if the target devices are of the right model and version of iOS. At the time of writing, there are public jailbreaks available for iOS up to version 12.2.\nBecause regular users typically would not (and should not) install jailbreaks on their iPhones and iPads, if the device you are testing shows appears jailbroken it is a very credible sign of a potential compromise. Following are some of the traces that might be left behind by a public jailbreak.\nLook for any jailbreak-related applications icons\nScan the phone for open ports\nTry to mount the full filesystem\n"},"ios/extract.html":{"url":"ios/extract.html","title":"Extract Data for Further Analysis","keywords":"","body":"Extract Data for Further Analysis\nlibimobiledevice is a cross-platform software library that allows to interact with iOS devices.\nInstall\nlibimobiledevice has packages for OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions, just do apt install libimobiledevice (or equivalent package manager).\nOn MAC OS, the easiest way is to install the HomeBrew package manager, and then install libimobiledevice with it with brew install ideviceinstaller\nThere is currently no easy way to install libimobiledevice on Windows, you will have to manually compile it on your system.\nExtract the Backup\nOnce libimobiledevice is installed, connect your iphone to your computer and accept the notification asking if your phone should trust the computer connected.\nYou can then check if the device is correctly connected with the computer with idevice_id -l :\n> idevice_id -l\n6ff8a10037495eaf054018ed79fbf0e7e3c5bc2f\nYou can then do a backup of the system with the command idevicebackup2 backup -d FOLDER.\n\nExtract Data to a Readable Format\nThe data extracted by libimobile device are not in a readable format, to convert them into data as they are on the phone, you have to use another tool like ideviceunback.\nFirst you need to download it and install it :\n$ git clone https://github.com/inflex/ideviceunback.git\n$ make\nYou can now extract the files from the backup :\n./ideviceunback -v -i path/to/backup -o output/path\n"},"license-credits.html":{"url":"license-credits.html","title":"License and Credits","keywords":"","body":"License and Credits\nThe authors of this guide are:\n\nClaudio Guarnieri\nEtienne Maynier\n\nThis guide is licensed as Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n"}}}
