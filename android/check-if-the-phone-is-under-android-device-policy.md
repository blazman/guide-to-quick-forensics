# Check if the Phone is under Android Device Policy

Go to Settings > Security > Device Administrators and make sure that none is enabled.

If the Android Device Policy app is installed and enabled in the above setting, make sure the Google Workspace domain that is managing the device is trusted. To do this, check signed-in Google accounts on the device (if they are under trusted Google Workspace domain).
