# Check if the Phone is Rooted

## Look for Root-Related Applications

When a phone is rooted, the process often involves installing an application to manage root access, most of the time [SuperSU](http://www.supersu.com/). One first step is to check if the SuperSU application is installed. You can check directly for the icon in your main menu, or go to **Settings > Applications** and search the application.
