# Checking Android Devices

In this section, we will go through some basic steps to check for malicious activity on an Android device.

**Warning:** because of their security model and their caracteristics, it is challenging to do live forensic on an Android system. We are bringing here some hints on what to check on a potentially compromised device, but this process is less reliable than the Windows or MacOS processes.

Here are the tools used in this section :
* [Checkey](https://guardianproject.info/apps/info.guardianproject.checkey/) developed by the Guardian Project to get information on APKs installed on your device
* [snoopdroid](https://github.com/botherder/snoopdroid) developed by Claudio Guarnieri to extract data from your phone for further analysis
