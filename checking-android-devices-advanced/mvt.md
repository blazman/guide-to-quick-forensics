# MVT

[Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT)](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) is a collection of utilities to simplify and automate the process of gathering forensic traces helpful to identify a potential compromise of Android and iOS devices.

On Android, MVT works mainly by collecting system information using [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
